# SomaFM for Sonos

_Please contact daniel@saewitz.com with your feedback or [submit issues here](https://github.com/switz/somafm-sonos). It's greatly appreciated!_

_WARNING: You can only have one custom music service on Sonos per SID at a time.
         If you already have gone through this process for another service it will replace your existing custom service.
         If not, you're all good. Move ahead.
         You can change the SID to another number like 251 and it will work._
